These are examples of the size display
on which I use Jupyter Notebook & Lab,
and the size font I use.

* `working.png` is with the file browser closed;
* `open-fb.png` is with the "I will consume all
  horizontal space!" file browser open.
* NB I use the display in inverted color mode,
  a fact that is never well-conveyed in screenshots.
  I have thereofre provided `working_r.png` and `open-fb_r.png`
  to show what the display truly looks like to
  me.
